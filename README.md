# GithubFinder

## Description

Much thanks to Brad Traversy. As this was something I was interested in, I found this tutorial to help me better understand how to work with React. This was invaluable to my learning. As I coded along, I would pause the video intermittenly to see if I can't make sense of the material I'm learning or if I can't begin working on the next part of the tutorial before Brad walks me through the solution.

## Goals

The following is what I learned from the project:

<ol>
    <li>Gained additional practice working with React, especially routes and switches</li>
    <li>Practiced working with React Fundamentals (Componenets, props, state, etc.)</li>
    <li>Gained experience working with React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext)</li>
    <li>Worked with a RESTFUL API in Github API</li>
</ol>
